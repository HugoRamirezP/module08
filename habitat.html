                <strong>The bald eagle</strong> typically requires old-growth and mature stands of coniferous or hardwood trees for perching, 
                roosting, and nesting. Tree species reportedly is less important to the eagle pair than the tree's height, 
                composition and location. Perhaps of paramount importance for this species is an abundance of comparatively 
                large trees surrounding the body of water. 
            </p>
            <p class="ibm">
                Selected trees must have good visibility, be over 20 m (66 ft) tall, 
                an open structure, and proximity to prey. If nesting trees are in standing water such as in a mangrove swamp, 
                the nest can be located fairly low, at as low 6 m (20 ft) above the ground. In a more typical tree standing 
                on dry ground, nests may be located from 16 to 38 m (52 to 125 ft) in height.
            </p>
            <p class="ibm"> 
                In Chesapeake Bay, nesting trees 
                averaged 82 cm (32 in) in diameter and 28 m (92 ft) in total height, while in Florida, the average nesting tree 
                stands 23 m (75 ft) high and is 23 cm (9.1 in) in diameter. Trees used for nesting in the Greater 
                Yellowstone area average 27 m (89 ft) high. Trees or forest used for nesting should have a canopy cover 
                of no more than 60%, and no less than 20%, and be in close proximity to water. Most nests have been found 
                within 200 m (660 ft) of open water. The greatest distance from open water recorded for a bald eagle nest was 
                over 3 km (1.9 mi), in Florida.

                In Florida, nesting habitats often consist of Mangrove swamps, 
                the shorelines of lakes and rivers, pinelands, seasonally flooded 
                flatwoods, hardwood swamps, and open prairies and pastureland with 
                scattered tall trees. Favored nesting trees in Florida are slash 
                pines <em>(Pinus elliottii)</em>, longleaf pines <em>(P. palustris)</em>, loblolly 
                pines <em>(P. taeda)</em> and cypress trees, but for the southern coastal 
                areas where mangroves are usually used.
            </p>
            <p class="ibm"> 
                In Wyoming, groves of 
                mature cottonwoods or tall pines found along streams and rivers are 
                typical bald eagle nesting habitats. Wyoming eagles may inhabit 
                habitat types ranging from large, old-growth stands of ponderosa 
                pines <em>(Pinus ponderosa)</em> to narrow strips of riparian trees surrounded 
                by rangeland. In Southeast Alaska, Sitka spruce <em>(Picea sitchensis)</em> 
                provided 78% of the nesting trees used by eagles, followed by 
                hemlocks <em>(Tsuga)</em> at 20%. Increasingly, eagles nest in human-made 
                reservoirs stocked with fish.
