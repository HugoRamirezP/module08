            <strong>The bald eagle</strong> is a powerful flier, and soars on thermal convection currents. 
            It reaches speeds of 56–70 km/h (35–43 mph) when gliding and flapping, 
            and about 48 km/h (30 mph) while carrying fish. Its dive speed is 
            between 120–160 km/h (75–99 mph), though it seldom dives vertically. 
            Regarding their flying abilities, despite being morphologically less 
            well adapted to faster flight than golden eagles <em>(especially during dives)</em>, 
            the bald eagle is considered surprisingly maneuverable in flight. 
            <strong>Bald eagles</strong> have also been recorded catching up to and then swooping under 
            geese in flight, turning over and thrusting their talons into the other bird's breast.

                It is partially migratory, depending on location. If its territory has access to open water, 
                it remains there year-round, but if the body of water freezes during the winter, making 
                it impossible to obtain food, it migrates to the south or to the coast. A number of 
                populations are subject to post-breeding dispersal, mainly in juveniles; Florida eagles, 
                for example, will disperse northwards in the summer. The bald eagle selects migration 
                routes which take advantage of thermals, updrafts, and food resources. During migration, 
                it may ascend in a thermal and then glide down, or may ascend in updrafts created by the 
                wind against a cliff or other terrain. Migration generally takes place during the daytime, 
                usually between the local hours of 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., when thermals are produced by the sun.
